# ui-service
A book CRUD web service front-end (use with back-end repository called management-service)

Use Case:
---------
As a book collector I want the ability to
create, and keep up to date, a catalogue of all my books. The catalogue
service should provide a list of all catalogued books from where I need
to be able to add new books, update existing information and remove
books.

Overview:
---------
Provide a multi-tier catalogue solution to add, edit, delete, and view current books. Build two separate Spring Boot services for an UI (User Interface) and Management Layer, with supporting DB. UI service must integrate the Management service\'s API utilizing a Jax-RS Client. Services should be packaged as executable jars, with all dependencies included. Scripts (Linux or Win) for service execution will be required.
